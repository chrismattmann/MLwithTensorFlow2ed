    "# Part of Speech Tagging and Word Sense Disambiguation using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapters 9 and 10 of the book are all about Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Ultimately they are probabilistic models of states, given certain observations. The idea is that you have states, _initial_ _probabilities_ for being in those states, and _transition_ _probabilities_ for transitioning from one state to another. The \"hidden\" portion of the Markov Model is that the \"true states\" are actually hidden normally, e.g., sometimes you can't directly measure if it's Sunny, or Rainy, but you may indirectly have the temperature as a measurement of the true or \"hidden\" state. Those measurements that you _do_ have are called _emissions_ and the final portion of an HMM is the probabilities that you are in the true hidden state S1...SN, given that you have a set of _emission_ _probabilities_ E1....EN for emission states 1...N.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book walks us through constructing an HMM example of Rainy, or Sunny, with observable emission states 'walk', 'shop' and 'clean'. In [Listing 9.1-9.6](../ch09/Listing%209.1-9.6.ipynb), I cover how to walk through the HMM step by step. The first example of the HMM is to compute the likelihood of observing a sequence of emission events, given the initial probabilities, transition probabilities and emission probabilities. The example is [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model#A_concrete_example). The Listing 9.1-9.6 notebook I provided walks through unfolding to learn more about how the HMM is actually doing the comuptation in this simple weather example. Basically in the first iteration to initialize, the HMM takes the first observation index, 0, aka 'walk' and multiplies the probabilities of walking when it is raining / sunny times by the initial probabilities of it being rainy or sunny to get a composite probability for it being rainy or sunny and having walked. Then the next step steps through the rest of the observations, 'shopping', 'shopping', 'cleaning', 'shopping', and does the following\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. for 'shopping', it takes the emission probability of seeing shopping in each state at that point, and multiplies it by the existing forward model, then applies the weighted transition probabilities in each actual state (Rainy or Sunny), through multiplication, and then accumulates them (through reduce_sum) to get the cumulitative probability of being in either state given the observations thus far ('walk', 'shopping')\n",
    "   2. it does the same thing for the next observations, 'shopping', 'cleaning' and 'shopping' to get the cumultative probability of being in either state\n",
    "   3. the final answer is the cumultation of either probability, so the likelihood of that sequence of events happening, but not necessarily the highest probability state you are in\n",
    "\n",
    "After we go through the HMM, we then focus on the Viterbi algorithm (yes, _that_ [Andrew Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/about-andrew-viterbi/)). The algorithm runs through the HMM, but keeps back propogation state, so that it can tell us the most likely hidden states, given the observations (or emissions) that we have seen. This is like keeping a map of the cumulative probabilities of being in Rainy, or Sunny, given the emissions you have seen so far - kind of like I described above. The second example in Chapter 9, [Listing 9.7-9.11](../ch09/Listing%209.7-9.11.ipynb), re-runs the Rainy/Sunny example, this time recommending the actual hidden states that you were in, given the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all to prepare us for the final chapter exercise which makes up Chapter 10, a new one in this version of the book. Use an HMM to model something. Most of the links in the book didn't work (e.g., the [Gait example](http://mng.bz/Tqfx) is a 1TB (movie?) download that you have to [fax something in for](http://www.cse.usf.edu/~sarkar/SudeepSarkar/Gait_Data.html)...._ummm no_). Finally, though, the end of chapter introduces something that we can actually do: use an HMM to model Part of Speech (PoS). This is basically the process of taking in a sentence, and tagging it appropriately with its parts of speech. I believe the book expected us to use the actual words of a sentence as the emission states, and the hidden states be the PoS tags, instead, after doing some research about the [Gutenberg corpus](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3203/pg3203.txt) that it recommends in the book, I stumbled across [this page](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) about the [Apertium Machine Translation platform](https://www.apertium.org/). That page is all about using HMMs for PoS disambiguation. The basic idea is that even after PoS tagging (and I even noticed this by creating a function for PoS tagging using Gutenberg, which is basically a list of 200K+ words, with multiple PoS classes like Adjective, Noun, Pronoun, etc.) all language has ambiguity. A great example is `engineer`. In English, it can be both a `Noun` and a `Verb`. The Apertium tagger has to handle these ambiguities in a PoS tagging scenario. Consider two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I love being an engineer and working at NASA JPL!\n",
    "I am hoping to engineer a future Mars rover vehicle!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the results of e.g., a PoS tagger without the capability for _disambiguation_ of a word's _sense_ or _word sense disambiguation_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I<Noun/> love<Adverb/> being<Verb/> an engineer<Noun/><Verb/> and<Conjunction/> at<Preposition/> NASA<Noun/> JPL<Noun/>.\n",
    "I<Noun/> am<Adverb/> hoping<Verb/> to engineer<Noun/><Verb/> a future Mars<Noun/> rover<Noun/> vehicle<Noun/>.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above two sentences, engineer is tagged as a Noun and a Verb by a PoS tagger that cannot deal with word sense disambiguation. So, the example for Apertium shows how its PoS tagger using HMMs to disambiguate. I thought this was a fantastic example, and it showed me basically how to construct the transition, emission, and initial probabilities. \n",
    "See below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Apertium-p1](../../figs/ch10-apertium-p1.png)\n",
    "![Apertium-p2](../../figs/ch10-apertium-p2.png?)\n",
    "\n",
    "You basically need 3 parallel corpora to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. A list of sentences, for me, I recorded five of my own sample sentences from sayings around the house that hopefully you get a kick out of.\n",
    "   2. A list of analyzed sentences from the original `morphological analysis` which is the process of running a PoS tagger that can't disambiguate yet. These should contain `ambiguity classes` that you need to disambiguate with their proper PoS tag.\n",
    "   3. A parallel tagged corpora that matches the analyzed sentences, expect instead of ambiguity, it has the proper tag that should be applied. \n",
    "   \n",
    "The jist of the algorithms to construct the matrices is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Transition Matrix: We are creating a bi-gram model, so you take all the PoS that Gutenberg can handle, ~14 tags, along with adding the 'sent' tag to it as the row names, and then for each column. Then you look at the tagged corpora, and count how many times each bi-gram pair occurs in which the row(first PoS tag) is followed by the second word (PoS) tag. We then divide the counts in each row by the total sum of all counts in that row. In essence this computes the ratio, or probability that e.g., Noun, will be followed by Verb compared to all of the other tags that follow Noun, or the `strength` of that particular transition. The resultant matrix is the transition probabilities e.g., from one hidden state, the PoS tag, to another.\n",
    "   2. Emission Matrix: For this matrix, we take all of the ambiguity classes, e.g., `<Noun/><Verb/>`, where it can't decide, and they become initial rows of the matrix, followed by the actual regular PoS class tags. The columns of the matrix are the PoS class tags. What we are computing in this matrix is the amount of times for each column PoS tag from the tagged corpus appears, whereas in the analyzed corpus, we see an ambiguity class instead. We then divide each of these counts by the total amount of times that PoS tag for the column appears in the tagged corpus. This gives us the `emission probability` for seeing an ambiguity class, instead of the correct PoS tag. Then, for the regular PoS tag classes, if it appears in the tagged corpus, and the analyzed corpus at least once, we write a 1 in the corresponding PoS tag col,row cell. \n",
    "   3. Initial probabilities: these are essentially the row in the Transition Matrix corresponding to the sent tag. In essence, it's the probabilities to move from a sentence end to the start of the next word in the corpus, or the probability that each word starts a sentence in the corpus. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Using those 3 algorithms, we can generate the needed input for the HMM to disambiguate word sense in PoS tags. I ended up learning tons about [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Data Frames, which was very useful. I applied them and wrote the functions necessary, and then refactored them heavily. After going through my small 5 sentence example and seeing that I didn't have enough evidence really to help do the disambiguation (it performed pretty poorly only disambiguating one of the words correctly in my test), I decided to use [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) [Test Corpora](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html) and the Brown corpus. I picked a random Brown file (`ch07`) that contained 133 sentences. Then, I had to write code to convert/translate between [NLTK's universal char tag set](https://github.com/slavpetrov/universal-pos-tags) and the Gutenberg set. So, I created a mapping between them of a subset of tags, and wrote a bunch of code to clean the data between them so that we could tag Gutenberg as an analyzer, and then use the NLTK tagged corpora for ground truth. \n",

    "I ended up getting it working after forever, and at the end of the day, my HMM PoS tagger is around <b>~79%</b> accurate, which isn't bad!\n",
